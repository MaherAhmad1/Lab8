# Relational Data

### Data, Information, and Knowledge
Data is the facts that no matter what can not be disputed, knowledge is what you think you know or believe, while information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose. These can all be contrasted too because if one piece of the puzzle does not fit then it can screw up the whole picture. The primary key within the customers and orders table could be thier email, or perhaps a phone number attached to the business. The customers and orders table would be related due to the fact that they are being given a service and we need a way to organize it. A foreign key could be the "Business ID". 

# Big Data

### Data, Information, and Knowledge
The four "V's" of big data are Volume, variety, velocity, and variability. Volume is the size of the data, variety is the nature and sources of the data, velocity is the speed of generation of the data (How fast it is generated and proccessed), lastly variabilty is the inconsistency which the data can show at times. New tech that has driven the increased needs for big data are the NYSE, Social Media, and Jet engines are a few examples. 

# Structured Query Language
RDBMS to put simply is a database management system and the way it relates to SQL is because SQL is the language used for communicating with the data in RDBMS. SQL is a special language designed to handle data in a relational database managment.  

# SQL Injections 
"SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database, SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques, SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input." As you can see SQL Injection is very risky due to it being able to ruin all the work and progress on any database and code. To reduce the issue you would have to have input validation and parametrized queries that way it would make the developer sanitze all the input. 

# Code of Ethics

### Ethical and Legal Implications
"A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group." The purpose of a code of ethics is to make sure that everything is done safely and properly. The difference between a code of ethics and AUP is that AUP is more of a contract that makes you agree with it before a service can be used (like public wifi) while a code of ethics are rules to be followed that can be broken. The example I choose to share will be of the Baldwin Wallace AUP of network access. "As the user will be given access to the BW network, Internet, and other IT resources, BW expects the user to use these resources in a responsible manner.The user must make a concerted effort to avoid accessing network data, files, and information that are not directly related to his or her job function if employed by BW or role as a student attending BW. The existence of access capabilities does not imply permission to use this access" I chose this one because it contains the intrest of online use which pertains to this classs in some aspects. (http://help.bw.edu/assets/policy/Policies/ITP-BW-01-AcceptableUsePolicy.pdf).

# Intellectual Property Ethical and Legal Implications
The importance and purpose of WIPO is that it serves as the global forum for IP services, policy, info and cooperation which is a huge part in non and governmental organizations. A copyright is simply obtained by the creator simply making the song, book, program, etc. The benefit of using the US Copyright Office is that a registred copyright is needed in order to bring legal action against someone stealing work, which can come in handy. The role of a trademark in defining the IP is that it protects the IP or work that is associated with the companies or people that made the item or service. 

### Information Collection
COPPA, FERPA, and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the internet by hiding important details about a person or service such as source code to a program or service, and medical files to a person or hospital records. Basically any information that is deemed sensitve will most likely be protected by one of these three. 

# Executive Summary
This was a pretty easy chapter to do and I had a good time reading the articles and chapters that were assigned so overall I think it was a fun assignment to work on for the class.
