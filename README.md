# Relational Data

### Data, Information, and Knowledge
Data is the facts that no matter what can not be disputed, knowledge is what you think you know or believe, while information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose. These can all be contrasted too because if one piece of the puzzle does not fit then it can screw up the whole picture. The primary key within the customers and orders table could be thier email, or perhaps a phone number attached to the business. The customers and orders table would be related due to the fact that they are being given a service and we need a way to organize it. A foreign key could be the "Business ID". 

# Big Data

### Data, Information, and Knowledge
The four "V's" of big data are Volume, variety, velocity, and variability. Volume is the size of the data, variety is the nature and sources of the data, velocity is the speed of generation of the data (How fast it is generated and proccessed), lastly variabilty is the inconsistency which the data can show at times. New tech that has driven the increased needs for big data are the NYSE, Social Media, and Jet engines are a few examples.
